# Python Project: pillow, tesseract, and opencv

*Python Programming Specialization* offered by Univesrity of Michigan on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project)

### The Assignment ###
Your task is to write python code which allows one to search through the images looking for the occurrences of keywords and faces. E.g. if you search for "pizza" it will return a contact sheet of all of the faces which were located on the newspaper page which mentions "pizza". This uses **OpenCV** to detect faces, **tesseract** to do optical character recognition, and **PIL** to composite images together into contact sheets.

Each page of the newspapers is saved as a single PNG image in a file called [images.zip](./readonly/images.zip). These newspapers are in english, and contain a variety of stories, advertisements and images. Note: This file is fairly large (~200 MB) and may take some time to work with. It's better to use **small_img.zip** for testing.

# File Description
 - **cv_project_finished.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with complete code and resulting outputs. 
 - **samll_img.zip**: smaller sized images used to test the code.
 - **images.zip**: contains all full sized images for the last run.
